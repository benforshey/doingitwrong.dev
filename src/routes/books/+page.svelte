<p>books of note, mostly professional</p>

<h2>Reading Now</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		The Pragmatic Programmer, 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Edition, by Andreq
		Hunt and David Thomas
		<p>
			This is my third read-through (once for me, two times for a book club I
			host). You might enjoy this if you can imagine software development as a
			craft which you&rsquo;d enjoy honing.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		API Design Patterns, by JJ Geewax
		<p>
			Picked it up because I was writing a lot of APIs. Continuing because
			it&rsquo;s got a lot of hard-earned wisdom that I&rsquo;m going to enjoy
			applying to my work.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Refactoring, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, by Martin Fowler
		<p>
			Picked it up because it&rsquo;s on many lists of classics. Keeping at it
			because most of the code I work with is not &ldquo;green-field&rdquo;.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
