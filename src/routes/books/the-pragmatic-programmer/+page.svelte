	<h2>Reading Notes</h2>

	<h3>Foreword / Preface</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>pp. xx&ndash;xxi: What &ldquo;Pragmatic Programmer&rdquo; characteristics do you share?</dt>
		<dd>
			I&rsquo;d love to say that I have them all, but I need to qualify this.
			<dl>
				<dt>Early adopter / fast adapter</dt>
				<dd>
					I&rsquo;ve worn the hat of senior developer before, so I know there&rsquo;s value in
					carefully weighing changes. But I <em>love</em> adopting / adapting in my own side projects&mdash;I
					mean, does anyone ever stop tinkering with their own site?! For projects that will be inherited,
					sometimes company culture matters more than the &ldquo;best&rdquo; technology choice.
				</dd>

				<dt>Inqusitive</dt>
				<dd>
					I think I do this pretty well. If I&rsquo;m honest, I also feel fatigue at the exponential
					growth of frameworks. I&rsquo;m not fatigued learning about languages, nor when reading
					distilled wisdom (<cite>Prag Prog</cite>, <cite>Refactoring</cite>, etc.)
				</dd>

				<dt>Critical Thinker</dt>
				<dd>
					I think I learned this one much better with time. I tend towards idealism, so when someone
					pitches me one (<i>GraphQL is the future!</i>), I tend to try it on for size. Getting
					stung a few times by that idealism helps temper it with prudence.
				</dd>

				<dt>Realistic</dt>
				<dd>
					Again, improved with time. I&rsquo;m categorically bad at accurate estimating and tend to
					believe (only for myself) that I&rsquo;m not allowed to get stuck on stuff&mdash;when
					things that are supposed to be hard, are hard, I still get bummed out.
				</dd>

				<dt>Jack of all trades</dt>
				<dd>I sure try. I enjoy being <i>T</i>&dash;shaped.</dd>

	<h3>Chapter One</h3>

	<dl>
		<dt>pp. 1&ndash;1: It&rsquo;s Your Life</dt>
		<dd>Do I act as if I have agency, or do I accept what I&rsquo;m not satisfied with?</dd>

		<dt>pp. 3&ndash;4: The Cat Ate My Source Code</dt>
		<dd>
			This is a message I need to hear now and again (though I consider myself a fairly trustworthy
			person): take responsibility for your actions. The thought of rubber ducking your excuse is
			particularly useful, as you'll have an opportunity to come up with options instead of lame
			excuses.
		</dd>

		<dt>pp. 6&ndash;8: Software Entropy</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;ll admit that the &ldquo;Broken Windows&rdquo; model of policing has its detractors
				(with good cause, I imagine), but I know in my core that I tent to treat shabby projects
				without the care they need. I love the practicality of suggesting that even a small step
				helps, like sending a 501 Not Implemented on that API endpoint that&rsquo;s not quite ready
				to be written.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;d be interested in exploring the tension between Martin Fowler&rsquo;s
				&ldquo;Litter&dash;Pickup Refactoring&rdquo; and the &ldquo;pull requests should be
				small&rdquo; mindset. My own thoughts? I think commits should be focused, but pull requests
				are only a burden because we don&rsquo;t pair program on features and we often don&rsquo;t
				write comprehensive tests to cover those features.
