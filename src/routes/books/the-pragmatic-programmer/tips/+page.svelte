<section>
	<h2>One Hundred Tips</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>p. xvi: &numero;1 Care About Your Craft</dt>
		<dd>
			Not just care about being right, or care about being respected: care about
			your craft.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. xvi: &numero;2 Think! About Your Work</dt>
		<dd>
			It&rsquo;s hard work but rewarding. You&rsquo;ll improve in your
			craftsmanship.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 1: &numero;3 You Have Agency</dt>
		<dd>
			&ldquo;You can change your organization or change your
			organization.&rdquo; &mdash;<cite>Martin Fowler</cite>
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 4: &numero;4 Provide Options, Don&rsquo;t Make Lame Excuses</dt>
		<dd>
			You can factor in everything that went wrong&mdash;including that which is
			outside your control&mdash;but holding yourself accountable and providing
			options to move forward shows humility and dedication to your craft.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 7: &numero;5 Don&rsquo;t Live with Broken Windows</dt>
		<dd>
			Hey, that project you worked on where that suite of tests didn't pass but
			you never fixed it? It&rsquo;s only getting worse&hellip;you&rsquo;ve
			stopped writing new tests.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 9: &numero;6 Be a Catalyst for Change</dt>
		<dd>
			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get
			permission.&rdquo; &mdash;<cite>Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper</cite>
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 10: &numero;7 Remember the Big Picture</dt>
		<dd>
			This differs from tip &numero; 7, in which one stops caring. When you lose
			sight of the big picture, you just don&rsquo;t notice how things
			deteriorate.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 12: &numero;8 Make Quality a Requirements Issue</dt>
		<dd>
			<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good"
				rel="noopener">Perfect is the enemy of good</a
			>
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 15: &numero;9 Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio</dt>
		<dd>
			Invest regularly; diversify; manage risk; buy low, sell high; review and
			rebalance.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 17: &numero;10 Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear</dt>
		<dd>Perhaps even get into a good discussion with a friend.</dd>

		<dt>p. 20: &numero;11 English is Just Another Programming Language</dt>
		<dd>
			Write natural language as you would natural code: honor the <dfn
				><abbr title="Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr></dfn
			>
			principle, the <dfn><abbr title="Easier To Change">ETC</abbr></dfn> principle,
			automation, etc.
		</dd>

		<dt>
			p. 22: &numero;12 It&rsquo;s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
		</dt>
		<dd>
			The more effective your communication, the more influential you can
			become.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 23: &numero;13 Build Documentation In, Don&rsquo;t Bolt It On</dt>
		<dd>
			Comment source code with the <em>why</em>; <em>how</em> should be apparent
			in your code. In&dash;code comments can capture engineering trade&dash;offs,
			why decisions were made, what other alternatives were discarded, etc.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 28: &numero;14 Good Design Is Easier to Change Than Bad Design</dt>
		<dd>
			<abbr>ETC</abbr> (Easier to Change) is a value&mdash;not a rule&mdash;that
			is the beating heart of many complex design principles. If you&rsquo;re not
			sure what is the appropriate change toward ETC, try to make what your code
			replaceable and describe the situation in your engineering daybook (tag it).
			When it&rsquo;s time to change the code, review your notes and train your initial
			instinct.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 31: &numero;15 Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself&</dt>
		<dd>
			Applies to code, documentation, data, <dfn
				><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></dfn
			>s, even developer knowledge.
		</dd>

		<dt>p. 38: &numero;16 Make It Easy to Reuse</dt>
		<dd>
			Foster an environment where it&rsquo;s easier to find and reuse existing
			stuff than to write it yourself.
		</dd>
