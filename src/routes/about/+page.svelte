		Me, Through the Lens of Personality Tests
	</h2>

	<p>
		I&rsquo;ve taken a number of personality tests over the years, but only a
		couple of them have deeply resonated with me. The <a
			href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">Enneagram</a
		>
		and
		<a
			href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">CliftonStrengths (by Gallup)</a
		> are probably my favorite two so far.
	</p>

	<h3>Clifton Strengths</h3>

	<p>
		This test has changed names a few times, but I know it as the
		CliftonStrengths assessment. &ldquo;Strengths&rdquo; is in the name, so
		unsurprisingly it focuses on your strengths, highlighting your top five
		categories (or themes) from a list of thirty&dash;four possible categories.
		To summarize: know your strengths so that you can use them well.
	</p>

	<p>
		I remember being so struck by the assessment that I laminated all five of my
		to themes; I wanted to grow into my strengths and shore up my weaknesses.
		Obviously, one needs to laminate that kind of knowledge. My top five themes:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Connectedness</li>
		<li>Learner</li>
		<li>Relator</li>
		<li>Intellection</li>
		<li>Achiever</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Highlights from Connectedness</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><q>&hellip;you consider people more important than things. </q></li>
		<li>
			<q>The value you place on humankind guides your decision-making.</q>
		</li>
		<li><q>Chances are good that you bring people together.</q></li>
		<li>
			<q
				>You have a gift for helping people discover what they have in common.</q
			>
		</li>
		<li><q>You might link together ideas no one else considered.</q></li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Highlights from Learner</h4>

	<ul>

		<li>
			<q
				>You persevere until you have gained the knowledge and skills needed to
				attain a goal.</q
			>
		</li>
		<li>
			<q

				people in small talk at a social event.</q
			>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Highlights from Relator</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>

				understand.</q

		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Highlights from Intellection</h4>

	<ul>

				your mind.</q

				theories, consider new concepts, or apply new technologies.</q
			>
		</li>
		<li>

				>You pose questions, evaluate answers, and figure out how things work.</q
			>

	</ul>

	<h4>Highlights from Acheiver</h4>

	<ul>

				be accomplished today.</q
			>
		</li>
		<li>
			<q
				>You ordinarily remain quite calm when others reverse their decisions,
				modify their schedules, or cancel their appointments.</q
			>
		</li>
		<li>
			<q
				>By nature, you are much more engaged in your work once you narrow down
				your priorities to a single activity.</q
			>
		</li>
		<li>
			<q
				>&hellip;you are often described as an industrious, no&dash;nonsense
				person.</q
			>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Enneagram</h3>

	<p>
		There are nine types, and I&rsquo;m a type one. My basic fear is that I'm
		broken or corrupt; my basic desire is to be good and balanced&mdash;full of
		integrity. Integrity is important to me, which probably explains why I named
		my freelance business Integris Web, LLC.
	</p>

			Ones are conscientious and ethical, with a strong sense of right and
			wrong. They are teachers, crusaders, and advocates for change: always
			striving to improve things, but afraid of making a mistake.
			Well-organized, orderly, and fastidious, they try to maintain high
			standards, but can slip into being critical and perfectionistic. They
			typically have problems with resentment and impatience. At their Best:
			wise, discerning, realistic, and noble. Can be morally heroic.
