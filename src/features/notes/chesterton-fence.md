# G.K. Chesterton's Fence

There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”

## My Thoughts

For now, it's good to "go away and think". There's probably a lot of wisdom in understanding how you got to a certain point, or what might cause someone to put a gate across a road&mdash;maybe then the cattle grate is the right tool.
