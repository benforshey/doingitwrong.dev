Each time I find one of those burrs that close relationships inevitably surface, I'll write about it. I'll write to remember, to study, and to grow. Next time, I'll know how to ask good questions about these topics&hellip;

My idea workplace will faithfully document institutional knowledge in order to empower developers. When one person holds up a team because they're busy holding up the team (see what I did there), that team needs to level themselves up. They should not be satisfied to let the one teammate carry the team. Do the hard work of the debrief and learn, then document. Document because knowledge is power, and you want a strong team.
