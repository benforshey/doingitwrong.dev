# What is Big O?

- way to categorize your algorithmâ€™s time or memory requirements
- not an exact measurement
- meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm

## Why do we use it?

It helps us make decisions about what data structures and algorithms to use. Knowing how they will perform can help you make the right decision between performance and complexity.
